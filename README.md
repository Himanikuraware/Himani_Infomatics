## Documentation

This project is built using React.js and TypeScript. The main reusable component, `ChartComponent`, is responsible for rendering the chart based on the provided data. It receives the title, description, and chart type as props from the parent component (`Dashboard`) and utilizes Chart.js for chart rendering. CSS modules are used for styling.

### Assumptions and Design Decisions

- The project assumes basic familiarity with React.js and Chart.js.
- The design decision was made to use CSS modules for styling to ensure component-level encapsulation and maintainability.
- The form validation checks for the presence of title, description, and selected chart type before generating the chart.
